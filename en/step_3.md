**Run** to test. You should see that your robot’s eyes move. Experiment with `top` and `left` until you get the eyes where you want them.

### Tip

You can use `bottom` instead of `top` to tell the browser how far from the bottom of the screen to show the image, as well as `right` instead of `left`.
